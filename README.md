# CoDev Studio

The app is a single page, `mobile/www/index.html`. It talks to Groq directly from the browser, so there's no backend server to run. The Android app is in `mobile/` (see `mobile/README.md`).

## Run it on your computer

**Windows:** double-click `start-codev.bat`. It opens http://localhost:3000 and, if Python is installed, starts the free search helper too.

**Any system:** `npm start`, then open http://localhost:3000. For web search on desktop, also run `python tools/ddgs-helper/ddgs_helper.py` (see `tools/ddgs-helper/README.md`).

`server.js` only serves the page on your own computer. It needs Node.js and nothing from `npm install`.

## "System Error: Failed to fetch"

This means the request never reached Groq (api.groq.com). Check that the computer is online, and that a firewall, antivirus web shield, VPN, proxy or ad blocker isn't blocking api.groq.com. A wrong API key shows a different error from Groq itself.
